🌍 EventSafe: AI-Powered Event Weather Safety System

EventSafe is an AI-driven platform that empowers event organizers, safety officers, and local authorities to plan safe outdoor gatherings using multi-source NASA Earth Observation data, real-time weather intelligence, and predictive analytics.

Our mission:

“To make every event safe, sustainable, and weather-resilient — powered by space-grade intelligence.”

🚀 Built for NASA Hackathon 2025

EventSafe integrates cutting-edge space and atmospheric datasets to deliver hyperlocal, AI-verified event safety scores.
The platform evaluates temperature, precipitation, wind anomalies, air quality, and disaster risk indices using NASA, OpenWeather, and Open-Meteo APIs.

🛰️ NASA Resources Utilized

EventSafe is built upon multiple NASA open datasets and APIs for enhanced reliability and insight:

NASA POWER API — for solar radiation, temperature, and humidity data

NASA GES DISC (Global Earth Science Data) — for climate reanalysis and precipitation monitoring

NASA Earth Observatory Data — for tracking atmospheric aerosols and extreme event visualization

NASA FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System) — to detect nearby wildfire activity

NASA SEDAC (Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center) — to integrate human population vulnerability and exposure indices

NASA Earthdata Cloud — to process real-time geospatial layers for rainfall and hazard prediction

NASA Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER) — to evaluate atmospheric stability for event conditions

By combining these sources with OpenWeather and Open-Meteo, EventSafe provides an unprecedented 360° view of environmental conditions surrounding an event location.
